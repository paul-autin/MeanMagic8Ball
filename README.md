# MeanMagic8Ball
It's a new spin on the classic "baby's first Python project" Magic 8 Ball - the twist is that there are two versions, and that both of them only have rude/mean answers. The one with the "int" tag in it binds answers to randomly generated integers between 1 and 15. The one with the "bank" tag in it just uses the "choice()" function to make a more streamlined version of the same process. Fun to play with in Linux terminal, especially since it hides the answers - that way, you won't be able to see what's heading your way.

You're welcome to download a copy and play with it yourself - I'm mostly just hosting this here so I can play with it on my Ubuntu VM without having to physically move the file around or email it to myself or whatever.
